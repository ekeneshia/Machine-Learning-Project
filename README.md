Objective:
Social media has become an important communication channel for staying up to date on critical events such as disasters. However; the sheer magnitude and diversity of posts it is hard to tell what is real. Platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook play crucial roles in circulating both essential and distracting information during disasters. Accurate classification of such information can help streamline emergency response efforts. This project utilizes three labeled datasets of tweets to build and evaluate effective models capable of performing this classification task.

## Resources (Software and Tools)
The project utilizes the following tools:
- **Python**: Main programming language for development 
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Frameworks for building and training CNN, BiLSTM, and RNN models
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for model evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data preprocessing and manipulation. 
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:**: Visualization tools for exploratory data analysis and performance metrics.
